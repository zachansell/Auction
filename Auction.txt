Auctioning System:
◾User interaction with currency
At any point, users must be able to send Wolvercoin to a single wallet address (possibly 0x97d6E73D6710fcF27Dd0cA3b9Db43a2AfA5b9BBB for absolutely no reason) in exchange for a physical representation of their currency, possibly different types of physical paper representing different unit sizes of the currency
Vice-versa: these pieces of paper may be exchanged with official representatives with access to that wallet in exchange for wolvercoin from said wallet
In order to prevent fraudulent creation of these pieces of paper, they must be of sufficient complexity either in form, material, or design such that only the official representatives are able to create new pieces, and that each piece is instantly recognizable as a physical representation of Wolvercoin

◾Selling user's interaction with auctions

◾Buying user's interaction with auctions
